# Market Chart Optimization

## Overview
This document describes the optimization implemented for the market chart component to improve performance when adding/removing technical indicators.

## Previous Behavior
- When removing indicators, the entire chart was recreated
- This caused a noticeable flicker and poor user experience
- The chart would lose zoom state and user interactions

## New Behavior
- Indicators are dynamically added/removed without recreating the chart
- The chart smoothly resizes using the `setSize()` method
- Navigator position updates dynamically
- Zoom state and user interactions are preserved

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes in MarketChart.tsx

1. **Removed Chart Recreation Logic**
   - Removed `shouldRecreateChart` state variable
   - Removed `recalculateLayout()` function that triggered recreation
   - Removed the useEffect that handled chart recreation

2. **Enhanced removeIndicator Function**
   ```typescript
   // Update chart height and navigator position dynamically
   const newHeight = calculateChartHeight();
   const newNavigatorTop = calculateNavigatorTop();
   
   // Check if chart still exists before updating
   if (!chartRef.current) {
     console.warn('[MarketChart] Chart reference lost during indicator removal');
     return;
   }
   
   // Update chart size
   chartRef.current.setSize(undefined, newHeight, false);
   
   // Update navigator position
   if (chartRef.current.navigator && chartRef.current.navigator.yAxis) {
     chartRef.current.navigator.yAxis.update({
       top: newNavigatorTop
     }, false);
   }
   
   // Single redraw after all updates
   chartRef.current.redraw();
   ```

3. **Added Safety Checks**
   - Added null check for `chartRef.current` before operations
   - Added existence check for navigator and yAxis properties
   - Added console warning when chart reference is lost

### Benefits
- **Performance**: No full chart recreation means faster indicator toggling
- **User Experience**: Smooth transitions without flickering
- **State Preservation**: Zoom level and selections are maintained
- **Reliability**: Safety checks prevent runtime errors

### Testing
The optimization was tested with:
- Adding/removing multiple indicators (Volume, MACD, RSI, ADX)
- Rapid toggling of indicators
- Different chart types (Candlestick, Line, Area)
- Different time ranges and view types

All scenarios showed smooth performance without errors.
