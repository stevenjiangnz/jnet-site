- Installs dependencies if needed
- Creates .env.local if missing
- Runs with Turbopack for fast refresh

- Creates virtual environment if needed
- Installs dependencies
- Runs with auto-reload

### `local-start-content.sh`
Starts the Node.js content service locally on port 3000.
- Installs dependencies if needed
- Sets environment variables
- Runs in development mode

### `local-build-all.sh`
Builds all services locally (except Python which doesn't need building).

### `local-test-all.sh`
Runs tests for all services in the local environment.

## üîß Setup and Utility Scripts

### `setup.sh`
Initial setup script that:
- Checks for required tools
- Creates .env.local from example
- Builds Docker images
- Starts all services
- Checks service health

### `test-all.sh`
Runs tests for all services in Docker containers.

### Deployment Scripts

#### `deploy-frontend-local-image.sh`
Deploys frontend using locally built Docker image (recommended for consistency).
- Builds Docker image locally
- Optionally tests image before deployment
- Pushes to Container Registry
- Ensures debugging consistency

#### `deploy-frontend-quick.sh`
Deploys frontend using Cloud Build (faster uploads).
- Auto-loads .env.local
- Uses Cloud Build for Docker image
- Includes post-deployment checklist

#### `deploy-frontend-cloud-run.sh`
**[DEPRECATED]** - Use `deploy-frontend-quick.sh` instead.

#### `deploy.sh <GCP_PROJECT_ID> [REGION]`
Deploys all services to Google Cloud Run.
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh YOUR_PROJECT_ID              # Default: us-central1
./scripts/deploy.sh YOUR_PROJECT_ID us-west1    # Custom region
```

### `setup-gcp-service-account.sh`
Sets up Google Cloud service account for deployment (if needed).

## üìù Notes

- All scripts include error checking
- Scripts are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Docker scripts assume docker-compose is installed
- Local scripts check for required runtimes before executing
- For detailed deployment scripts comparison, see `../docs/DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPTS_COMPARISON.md`
