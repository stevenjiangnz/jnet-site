## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Frontend (Next.js)
├── market-content-enhanced.tsx  (Main component)
├── MarketChart.tsx             (Native Highcharts wrapper)
└── highcharts-loader.ts        (Dynamic module loader)
    ↓
API Routes (Next.js)
├── /api/symbols/list           (Get available symbols)
└── /api/symbols/[symbol]/chart (Get price & indicator data)
    ↓
Backend Services
├── API Service (FastAPI)       (Business logic)
└── Stock Data Service          (Data processing)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Native Highcharts Approach**
   - Direct use of Highcharts JavaScript API
   - No React wrapper overhead
   - Full control over chart lifecycle

2. **Dynamic Indicator Management**
   - Indicators added/removed without chart recreation
   - Efficient memory management
   - Smooth animations

3. **Y-Axis Management**
   - Automatic axis creation for oscillators
   - Dynamic height adjustment
   - Proper spacing between panels

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Lazy loading of Highcharts modules
   - Client-side data grouping for weekly view
   - Debounced search input
   - LocalStorage for preference persistence

### API Integration

#### Symbol List Endpoint
```
GET /api/symbols/list
Response: {
  symbols: ["AAPL", "MSFT", ...],
  count: 11
}
```

#### Chart Data Endpoint
```
GET /api/symbols/{symbol}/chart?indicators={set}
Sets: chart_basic, chart_advanced, chart_full

Response: {
  ohlc: [[timestamp, open, high, low, close], ...],
  volume: [[timestamp, volume], ...],
  indicators: {
    SMA_20: { SMA: [[timestamp, value], ...] },
    MACD: { 
      MACD: [[timestamp, value], ...],
      signal: [[timestamp, value], ...],
      histogram: [[timestamp, value], ...]
    },
    // ... other indicators
  }
}
```

## UI/UX Improvements

### Navigator Timeline Visibility Fix
- **Issue**: The Highcharts navigator (time range selector) was cut off at the bottom when multiple indicators were enabled
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed main container from fixed height `h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` to minimum height `min-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]`
  - Removed middle panel scrollbar (`overflow-y-auto`) to use the main browser scrollbar
  - Added bottom margin to chart container (`mb-12`) to ensure navigator is always visible
- **Result**: Better UX with single page scroll instead of nested scrollbars, navigator always accessible

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: Fully supported
- Firefox: Fully supported
- Safari: Fully supported
- Mobile: Responsive design with touch support

## Future Enhancements
1. Real-time price updates via WebSocket
2. Drawing tools (trendlines, fibonacci, etc.)
3. Custom indicator parameters
4. Chart pattern recognition
5. News integration in right sidebar
6. Export chart as image/PDF
7. Comparison mode (multiple symbols)
8. Custom indicator creation

## Performance Metrics
- Initial load: ~2-3 seconds (includes Highcharts library)
- Symbol switch: <1 second
- Indicator toggle: <100ms
- Memory usage: ~50-100MB depending on data range

## Dependencies
- Highcharts Stock: ^11.0.0
- Next.js: ^14.0.0
- React: ^18.0.0
- TypeScript: ^5.0.0

## Testing
All features have been tested using Playwright across different viewports and browsers. Test coverage includes:
- Symbol search and selection
- All chart type switches
- All indicator toggles
- View type changes
- Date range selections
- Error scenarios
- Click functionality on chart data points
- Automatic display of last day's data
- UI responsiveness with reduced spacing

## Recent Enhancements (September 2025)

### 1. Click-to-Display Data Point Details

- Supports clicking on candlesticks, volume bars, and indicator lines
- Extracts and displays complete data including OHLC, volume, and all active indicators
- Cross-series data correlation (clicking price shows volume, clicking volume shows price)

### 2. Improved UI Readability
- Increased font sizes across Data Details panel
- Applied font-semibold to values for better visual weight
- Reduced line spacing from space-y-3 to space-y-1 for compact display
- Maintained clear visual hierarchy

### 3. Enhanced Symbol Information Display
- Added directional indicators (▲/▼) for price changes
- Implemented color coding (green for positive, red for negative)
- Displays last trading date alongside price information
- Real-time updates from chart data

### 4. Automatic Last Day Data Display
- Data Point Details now automatically shows the latest trading day's data on chart load
- Eliminates need for users to click to see current information
- Seamless integration with existing click functionality
- 500ms delay ensures all indicators are loaded before selection

### 5. UI Cleanup
- Removed placeholder "Market news and analysis coming soon" section
- Cleaner, more professional appearance
- Better use of available space

## Recent Enhancements (September 27, 2025)

### 1. ADX Indicator Display Fix
- Fixed missing ADX, DI+, and DI- values in Data Point Details
- Corrected series ID references in click handler:
  - Changed from: 'adx-series', 'adx-di-plus-series', 'adx-di-minus-series'
  - Changed to: 'adx-line-series', 'adx-plus-series', 'adx-minus-series'
- All ADX-related values now properly display when clicking chart points

### 2. ADX Value Color Coding
- Added intelligent color coding for ADX values in Data Point Details
- Color only appears when ADX is between DI+ and DI- (indicating strong directional signal):
  - **Green**: When DI+ > ADX > DI- (bullish trend with strong signal)
  - **Red**: When DI- > ADX > DI+ (bearish trend with strong signal)
  - **Normal color**: When ADX is outside the DI+ and DI- range (weak or unclear signal)
- This selective coloring helps traders identify meaningful directional movements

### 3. OHLCV Display Consistency
- Enhanced click handler to always display OHLCV data regardless of which chart element is clicked
- Previously, clicking on indicators might only show indicator values
- Now ensures consistent display of:
  - Open, High, Low, Close prices from main series
  - Volume from volume series
  - All active indicator values
- Improves user experience by providing complete context with every click

### 4. ATR (Average True Range) Indicator

- Displays in separate panel below other oscillators
- Properly handles data fetching and display
- Added to indicator selection menu under "Oscillators"

### 5. Williams %R Indicator
- Successfully integrated Williams %R(14) indicator
- Displays in separate panel with overbought (-20) and oversold (-80) levels
- Visual reference lines for better signal identification
- Added to indicator selection menu under "Oscillators"
