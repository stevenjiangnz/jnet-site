git commit -m "feat: add host-based GitHub Actions runner setup

- Remove K3d/Kubernetes runner setup (incompatible with Docker workflows)
- Add host-based runner scripts for full Docker support  
- Support multiple runners (one per repository)
- Add start/stop/status/remove management scripts
- Add systemd service configuration support
- Update documentation and .gitignore

This setup allows running GitHub Actions directly on Ubuntu host with
full Docker support, avoiding K3d containerization limitations.
