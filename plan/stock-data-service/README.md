2. **Phase 2: Incremental Updates** (Week 3-4)
3. **Phase 3: Redis Caching** (Week 5)
4. **Phase 4: Weekly Aggregation** (Week 6)
5. **Phase 5: Profile System** (Week 7)
6. **Phase 6: Testing & Optimization** (Week 8)

## Key Objectives
1. **Persistent Storage**: Migrate from local files to Google Cloud Storage
2. **Efficient Updates**: Implement incremental data updates to minimize API calls
3. **Performance**: Add Redis caching for sub-100ms response times
4. **Data Aggregation**: Generate weekly data from daily data
5. **Monitoring**: Build comprehensive profile and monitoring system

## Architecture Overview

### Current State
```
User Request → API → Local File System → Response
```

### Target State
```
User Request → API → Redis Cache → GCS Storage → Response
                ↓                      ↓
          Cache Hit (100ms)      Cache Miss (500ms)
```

- Graceful degradation when cache unavailable
- Cache management API

**Success Metrics**:
- Cache hit rate > 80%
- Response time < 100ms for cached data
- Zero downtime when cache fails

### [Phase 4: Weekly Aggregation](phase4-weekly-aggregation.md)
**Goal**: Generate weekly data aggregates for different analysis timeframes

**Key Deliverables**:
- Weekly aggregation engine with OHLCV calculations
- Automated weekly data generation
- API endpoints for weekly data access
- Proper handling of market holidays

**Success Metrics**:
- 100% accuracy in calculations
- Weekly updates complete within 5 seconds
- API response time < 200ms

### [Phase 5: Profile System](phase5-profile-system.md)
**Goal**: Create comprehensive monitoring and inventory management

**Key Deliverables**:
- Data inventory scanner
- System and symbol profile generation
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Automated reporting and alerting

**Success Metrics**:
- Profile generation < 30 seconds
- Real-time metrics available
- Automated issue detection
