## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Docker Development

```bash
# Quick start - builds and starts all services
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start all services
./scripts/docker-up.sh

# Stop all services
./scripts/docker-down.sh

# View logs
./scripts/docker-logs.sh              # All services
./scripts/docker-logs.sh frontend     # Specific service

# Build services
./scripts/docker-build.sh             # All services
./scripts/docker-build.sh frontend    # Specific service

# Restart services
./scripts/docker-restart.sh           # All services
./scripts/docker-restart.sh frontend  # Specific service

# Clean up Docker resources
./scripts/docker-clean.sh

# Setup stock-data service with persistent volume
./scripts/docker-setup-stock-data.sh
```

### Stock Data Service

The stock-data service downloads EOD (End of Day) stock and ETF data from Yahoo Finance:

- **Persistent Storage**: Downloaded files are stored in `services/stock-data-service/data/downloads/`
- **Data Formats**: Supports JSON and CSV output formats
- **API Documentation**: Available at http://localhost:9001/docs
- **Volume Mount**: Uses Docker external volume to persist data across container restarts

### API Service

The API service provides business logic layer for trading and analysis features:

- **Backtesting**: Run trading strategies using Backtrader
- **Stock Scanner**: Find stocks matching specific criteria
- **Technical Analysis**: Calculate indicators and generate trading signals
- **Alerts**: Price and indicator-based alert system
- **Notifications**: Push notifications via Pushover and email
- **API Documentation**: Available at http://localhost:8002/docs
- **Stock Data Endpoints**: Formatted data for Highcharts frontend integration

### Local Development (without Docker)

```bash
# Start services locally
./scripts/local-start-frontend.sh     # Frontend on port 3100
./scripts/local-start-stock-data.sh   # Stock Data service on port 9000
cd services/api-service && ./scripts/run_local.sh  # API service on port 8002

# Build all services locally
./scripts/local-build-all.sh

# Run tests locally
./scripts/local-test-all.sh
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Docker environment
./scripts/test-all.sh

# Local environment
./scripts/local-test-all.sh
```

## üö¢ Deployment

### Required GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository for CI/CD:

**Core Secrets:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud project ID
- `GCP_SA_KEY`: Service account JSON key for Cloud Run deployment
- `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username (optional, defaults to 'stevenjiangnz')

**API Service Secrets:**
- `API_SERVICE_KEY`: API key for api-service authentication
- `STOCK_DATA_SERVICE_URL`: URL of the stock-data-service (e.g., https://stock-data-service-506487697841.us-central1.run.app)
- `STOCK_DATA_SERVICE_API_KEY`: API key for stock-data-service authentication
- `API_KEY`: Frontend API key for accessing api-service
- `API_BASE_URL`: API service base URL (e.g., https://api-service-506487697841.us-central1.run.app)

**Stock Data Service Secrets:**
- `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`: Google Cloud Storage bucket name for stock data

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment with environment protections and a unified deployment strategy:

#### Develop Branch
- Triggers on push to `develop` branch when service files are changed
- Runs tests for the affected service
- Builds and pushes Docker images with tags:
  - `develop`
  - `develop-{git-sha}`
- **Deployment**: Requires manual approval via `development` environment
  - Deploys to the same Cloud Run services as production
  - Uses development-specific environment variables and configurations

#### Main Branch (Production)
- Triggers on push to `main` branch when service files are changed
- Runs tests for the affected service
- Calculates semantic version based on git tags
- Builds and pushes Docker images with tags:
  - `latest`
  - Semantic version (e.g., `1.2.3`)
- Creates a GitHub release
- **Deployment**: Requires manual approval via `production` environment
  - Deploys to Cloud Run services
  - Uses production environment variables and configurations

#### Unified Deployment Strategy
Both development and production environments deploy to the same Cloud Run services:
- **api-service**: API backend service
- **frontend**: Next.js frontend application  
- **stock-data-service**: Stock/ETF data service

The environments are differentiated by:
- Docker image tags (semantic versions for production, commit hashes for development)
- Environment variables (development vs production settings)
- Manual approval requirements ensure controlled deployments

#### Environment Configuration
Configure deployment environments in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Environments:
- **development**: Controls develop branch deployments
- **production**: Controls main branch deployments

For each environment, you can configure:
- Required reviewers for manual approval
- Deployment branch restrictions
- Environment-specific secrets
- Deployment protection rules

#### Manual Deployment

Deploy to Google Cloud Run:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you encounter "address already in use" errors when starting services:

```bash
# For frontend (port 3100)
sudo lsof -ti:3100 | xargs -r sudo kill -9
# Or
sudo fuser -k 3100/tcp

# For API service (port 8002)
sudo lsof -ti:8002 | xargs -r sudo kill -9

# For stock data service (port 9000)
sudo lsof -ti:9000 | xargs -r sudo kill -9

# Kill all Next.js processes
pkill -f "next dev"
pkill -f next-server
```
